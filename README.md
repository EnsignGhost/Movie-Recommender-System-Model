# Movie-Recommender-System-Model

### Prepare a Movie recommender model by using sklearn library.

### There are basically three type of recommender system present - 
 1. Content Based
 2. Collaborative Filtering (Mostley used now-a-days)
 3. Hybrid (both)

### I use Content Based recommender system in my model.

### Project Flow - 
Data --> Preprocessing --> Model.

#### I use following things for my model- 
##### Data Merge , Filtering , Stemming by using nltk library , Vectoring.

I convert all data into Vector so it will become easy to find similar movie according to user's choice.
